# GeoBlocks - Catalogue of Geometries

This is the catalogue of standard geometries created in the Geoblocks project, as introduced in Carl et al., 2023a: "Host rock analysis for the German nuclear waste disposal site-selection: review of subsurface geometries and input data for geological modelling".  According to the extended abstract and references therein, standard geometries were constructed for the 4 potential host rock types in the German site-selection for high-level radioactive waste disposal (StandAG, 2017):
1. Claystone/shale
2. Crystalline rocks
3. Stratiform salt
4. Steep salt

The structure of the catalogue is chosen according to the systematizations outlined in Carl et al., 2023a. Therefore, the categorization differs from the systematics applied by the BGE. This might be subject to change.
